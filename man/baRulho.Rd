\title{baRulho: quantifying habitat-induced acoustic signal degradation}
\description{
`baRulho` is a package intended to quantify habitat-induced degradation of (animal) acoustic signals.
}
\details{
The main features of the package are:
  \itemize{
  \item Loops to apply tasks through sounds referenced in an extended selection table
  \item The comparison of playback sounds re-recorded at different distances
  }
Most functions allow the parallelization of tasks, which distributes the tasks among several processors to improve computational efficiency.
