-**Model sound**: sound in which transmission properties will be studied, usually found in the original field recordings or synthetic sound files.

-**Reference sound**: sound to use as a pattern to compare against. Usually created by re-recording a model sound broadcast at 1 m from the source (speaker).

-**Sound ID**: ID of sounds used to identify counterparts across distances. Each sound must have a unique ID within a distance.

-**Ambient noise**: energy from background sounds in the recording, excluding sounds of interest.  

-**Test sound**: sounds re-recorded far from the source to test for transmission/degradation (also refer to as 're-recorded' sounds).

-**Degradation**: term used to describe any changes in the structure of a sound when transmitted in a given habitat (note that there is no agreement on this terminology in the scientific community).

Most [baRulho](https://marce10.github.io/baRulho/) functions are design to quantify sound degradation. There are a few important things to keep in mind about functions for quantifying degradation:

- The package currently assumes that all recordings have been made with the same equipment and recording volume. This will be modified in future versions to allow for amplitude calibration of recordings.
- Wave envelope and frequency spectrum calculations are made after applying a bandpass filter within the frequency range of the reference sound ('bottom.freq' and 'top.freq' columns)
- The package offers two methods to compare sounds to the reference: 
    1. Compare all sounds with the counterpart that was recorded at the closest distance to source (e.g. compare a sound recorded at 5m, 10m and 15m with its counterpart recorded at 1m). This is the default method.
    1. Compare all sounds with the counterpart recorded at the distance immediately before (e.g. a sound recorded at 10m compared with the one recorded at 5m, then sound recorded at 15m compared with the one recorded at 10m and so on).


## Required data structure

The input data should contain some additional information. [baRulho](https://marce10.github.io/baRulho/) comes with an example `extended_selection_table` data set that can be used to understand the required data structure:
s
```{r,eval=FALSE}

data("playback_est")

```


```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}

data("playback_est")

kbl <- kable(playback_est, align = "c", row.names = F, format = "html", escape = F)

kbl <- column_spec(kbl, 7:8, background = "#ccebff", bold = TRUE)

kbl <- kable_styling(kbl, bootstrap_options = "striped", font_size = 12)

kbl <- scroll_box(kbl, height = "400px")

kbl
```
&nbsp;
 
 Note that besides the basic acoustic annotation information (e.g. sound file, time, frequency) the table also contains a **'sound.id' column, which contains the ID of sounds used to identify correspondent sounds across distances**, a **'distance' column that refers to the distance from the source at which each sound was recorded** and a **'transect' column' that (surprise!) identify sounds (rows) from the same transect**. The combined information from these columns is used to identify the reference sounds for each test sound. The function `set_reference_sounds()` does exactly that. There are two possible experimental designs whe defining reference sounds (which is controlled by the argument 'method' in `set_reference_sounds()`):

- 1: compare sounds (by 'sound.id') with their counterpart that was recorded at the closest distance to source (e.g. compare a sound recorded at 5m, 10m and 15m with its counterpart recorded at 1m). This is the default method. The function will try to use references from the same transect. However, if there is another test sound from the same 'sound.id' at a shorter distance in other transects, it will be used as reference instead.
- 2: compare all sounds with their counterpart recorded at the distance immediately before within a transect (e.g. a sound recorded at 10m compared with the same sound recorded at 5m, then sound recorded at 15m compared with same sound recorded at 10m and so on).


Also note that some selections are labeled as "ambient" in the 'sound.id'. These selections refer to ambient (background) noise. Ambient noise can be used by some functions to correct for amplitude differences due to non-target sounds.
 
In this example data there are 4 recordings at increasing distances: 1m, 5m, 10m and 15m:

```{r,eval=TRUE}

# count selection per recordings
unique(playback_est$sound.files)

playback_est <- playback_est[playback_est$sound.files != "master.wav", ]

```

The data contains selections for 5 sounds as well as 2 ambient noise selections at each distance/recording:

```{r, eval = FALSE}

table(playback_est$sound.id, playback_est$distance)

```

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo=FALSE}

tb <- table(playback_est$sound.id, playback_est$distance)

kbl <- kable(tb, align = "c", row.names = TRUE, format = "html", escape = F)

kbl <- kable_styling(kbl, bootstrap_options = "striped", font_size = 12)

kbl
```


## Degradation measurements  

### Blur ratio
 
Blur ratio quantifies the degradation of sound as a function of the distortion of the amplitude envelope (time domain) while excluding changes due to energy attenuation. This measure was first described by Dabelsteen et al. (1993). Blur ratio is measured as the mismatch between amplitude envelopes (expressed as probability density functions) of the reference sound and the re-recorded sound. Low values indicate low degradation of sounds.  The function `blur_ratio()` measures the blur ratio of sounds in which a reference playback has been re-recorded at different distances. The function compares each sound to the corresponding reference sound within the supplied frequency range (e.g. bandpass) of the reference sound ('bottom.freq' and 'top.freq' columns in 'X'). The 'sound.id' column must be used to tell the function to only compare sounds belonging to the same category (e.g. song-types). All sound files (or wave objects in the extended selection table) must have the same sampling rate so the length of envelopes is comparable.
Blur ratio can be calculated as follows:

```{r, eval = FALSE}

# run blur ratio
br <- blur_ratio(playback_est)

# check output class
is_extended_selection_table(br)
```

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}

# run blur ratio
br <- blur_ratio(playback_est, method = 1, img = FALSE, pb = FALSE)

# check output class
is_extended_selection_table(br)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}

# see output
br
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}

kbl <- kable(br, align = "c", row.names = F, format = "html", escape = F)

kbl <- column_spec(kbl, 9:10, background = "#ccebff", bold = TRUE)

kbl <- kable_styling(kbl, bootstrap_options = "striped", font_size = 10)

kbl <- scroll_box(kbl, height = "400px")

kbl
```
&nbsp;

The output data frame is similar to input data, except that it includes two new columns ('reference' and 'blur.ratio') with the reference sound and blur ratio values. Note that `NAs` are returned for sounds used as reference and 'ambient' noise selections.

If `img = TRUE` it also returns 1 image file (in 'jpeg' format) for each comparison showing spectrograms of both sounds and the overlaid amplitude envelopes (as probability mass functions (PMF)). 

```{r, eval = FALSE}

# run blur ratio
br <- blur_ratio(playback_est, method = 1, img = TRUE, ssmooth = 300, dest.path = td)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}

sbr <- blur_ratio(playback_est, method = 1, img = TRUE, dest.path = tempdir(), pb = FALSE)

# make the gif here
# https://ezgif.com
```

Output image files (in the working directory) look like these ones:

<center><img src="blur_ratio_example.gif" alt="time sync with realign_test_sounds"></center>

&nbsp;

The image shows the spectrogram for the reference and re-recorded sound, as well as the envelopes of both sounds overlaid in a single graph. Colors indicate to which sound spectrograms and envelopes belong to. The blur ratio value is also displayed.

The function can also return the amplitude spectrum contours when the argument `envelopes = TRUE`. The contours can be directly input into ggplot to visualize amplitude envelopes, and how they vary with distance and across sound types (and ambient noise if included):

```{r}

# get envelopes
br <- blur_ratio(X = playback_est, envelopes = TRUE)
envs <- attributes(br)$envelopes

# make distance a factor for plotting
envs$distance <- as.factor(envs$distance)

# plot
ggplot(envs, aes(x= time, y = amp, col = distance)) +
geom_line() + facet_wrap(~ sound.id) +
scale_color_manual(values = viridis::viridis(4)) +
labs(x = "Time (s)", y = "Amplitude (PMF)") +
theme_classic()

```

Note than the `smooth` argument could change envelope shapes and related measurements. The following code sets `smooth = 800`:

```{r}

# get envelopes
br <- blur_ratio(X = playback_est, envelopes = TRUE)
envs <- attributes(br)$envelopes

envs$distance <- as.factor(envs$distance)

ggplot(envs, aes(x = time, y = amp, col = distance)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~sound.id) +
  scale_color_viridis_d(alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(x = "Time (s)", y = "Amplitude (PMF)") +
  theme_classic()
```

&nbsp;

### Spectrum blur ratio
 
Spectrum blur ratio (measured by `spectrum_blur_ratio()`) quantifies the degradation of sound as a function of the change in sound energy across the frequency domain, analogous to the blur ratio described above for the time domain (and implemented in `blur_ratio()`). Low values also indicate low degradation of sounds. Spectrum blur ratio is measured as the mismatch between power spectra (expressed as probability density functions) of the reference sound and the re-recorded sound. It works in the same way than `blur_ratio()`, comparing each sound to the corresponding reference sound, and the output and images are alike as well.

Spectrum blur ratio can be calculated as follows:

```{r, eval = FALSE}

# run Spectrum blur ratio
sbr <- spectrum_blur_ratio(playback_est, method = 1, img = TRUE, dest.path = td)

# check output class
is_extended_selection_table(sbr)
```

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}

# run Spectrum blur ratio
sbr <- spectrum_blur_ratio(playback_est, method = 1, pb = FALSE)

# check output class
is_extended_selection_table(sbr)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}

sbr <- spectrum_blur_ratio(playback_est, method = 1, img = TRUE, dest.path = tempdir())

# make the gif here
# https://ezgif.com
```


```{r, eval = FALSE}

# see output
sbr
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}

kbl <- kable(sbr, align = "c", row.names = F, format = "html", escape = F)

kbl <- column_spec(kbl, 9:10, background = "#ccebff", bold = TRUE)

kbl <- kable_styling(kbl, bootstrap_options = "striped", font_size = 10)

kbl <- scroll_box(kbl, height = "400px")

kbl
```
&nbsp;

<center><img src="spectrum_blur_ratio_example.gif" alt="spectrum blur-ratio"></center>

&nbsp;

As in `blur_ratio()`, `spectrum_blur_ratio()` can also return the amplitude spectrum contours with the argument `spectra = TRUE`:

```{r}
sbr <- spectrum_blur_ratio(X = playback_est, spectra = TRUE)

spctr <- attributes(sbr)$spectra

spctr$distance <- as.factor(spctr$distance)

ggplot(spctr[spctr$freq > 0.3, ], aes(y = amp, x = freq, col = distance)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~sound.id) +
  scale_color_viridis_d(alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(x = "Frequency (kHz)", y = "Amplitude (PMF)") +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_classic()

```

We can also zoom in to the frequency range of the sounds by subsetting the spectrum data:

```{r}

# get the frequencies higher than lowest bottom but lower than highest top freq
spctr <- spctr[spctr$freq > min(playback_est$bottom.freq) & spctr$freq < max(playback_est$top.freq), ]

ggplot(spctr, aes(y = amp, x = freq, col = distance)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~sound.id) +
  scale_color_viridis_d(alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(x = "Frequency (kHz)", y = "Amplitude (PMF)") +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_classic()
```
&nbsp;

### Excess attenuation

With every doubling of distance, sounds attenuate with a 6 dB loss of amplitude (Morton, 1975; Marten & Marler, 1977). Any additional loss of amplitude results in excess attenuation, or energy loss in excess of that expected to occur with distance via spherical spreading, due to atmospheric conditions or habitat (Wiley & Richards, 1978). This degradation metric can be measured using the `excess_attenuation()` function. Low values indicate little sound attenuation. The function will then compare each sound to the corresponding reference sound within the frequency range (e.g. bandpass) of the reference sound ('bottom.freq' and 'top.freq' columns in 'X'). Two methods for calculating excess attenuation are provided (see 'method' argument).

`excess_attenuation()`  can be measured like this:

```{r, eval = TRUE}

# run  envelope correlation
ea <- excess_attenuation(playback_est, method = 1, pb = FALSE)

# check output class
is_extended_selection_table(ea)
```


The output, similar to those of other functions, is an extended selection table with the input data, but also including two new columns ('reference' and  'excess.attenuation') with the reference sound and the excess attenuation:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# print output
ea
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}

kbl <- kable(ea, align = "c", row.names = F, format = "html", escape = F)

kbl <- column_spec(kbl, 9:10, background = "#ccebff", bold = TRUE)

kbl <- kable_styling(kbl, bootstrap_options = "striped", font_size = 10)

kbl <- scroll_box(kbl, height = "400px")

kbl
```

&nbsp;

### Envelope correlation

Amplitude envelope correlation measures the similarity of two sounds in the time domain. The `envelope_correlation()` function measures the envelope correlation coefficients between reference playback and re-recorded sounds. Values close to 1 means very similar amplitude envelopes (i.e. little degradation has occurred). If envelopes have different lengths (that is when sounds have different lengths) cross-correlation is applied and the maximum correlation coefficient is returned. Cross-correlation is achieved by sliding the shortest sound along the largest one and calculating the correlation at each step. As in the functions detailed above, 'sound.id' column must be used to instruct the function to only compare sounds that belong to the same category.

`envelope_correlation()` can be run as follows:

```{r, eval = TRUE}

# run  envelope correlation
ec <- envelope_correlation(playback_est, method = 1, pb = FALSE)

# check output class
is_extended_selection_table(ec)
```

The output is also similar to those of other functions; an extended selection table similar to input data, but also includes two new columns ('reference' and  'envelope.correlation')
with the reference sound and the amplitude envelope correlation coefficients:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# print output
ec
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}

kbl <- kable(ec, align = "c", row.names = F, format = "html", escape = F)

kbl <- column_spec(kbl, 9:10, background = "#ccebff", bold = TRUE)

kbl <- kable_styling(kbl, bootstrap_options = "striped", font_size = 10)

kbl <- scroll_box(kbl, height = "400px")

kbl
```

&nbsp;

Note that this function doesn't provide a graphical output. However, the graphs generated by `blur_ratio()` can be used to inspect the envelope shapes and the alignment of sounds.

### Spectrum correlation

Spectrum correlation measures the similarity of two sounds in the frequency domain. This is similar to `envelope_correlation()`, but in the frequency domain. Both sounds are compared within the frequency range of the reference sound (so both spectra have the same length). Again, values near 1 indicate identical frequency spectrum  (i.e. no degradation). 

```{r, eval = TRUE}

# run spectrum correlation
sc <- spectrum_correlation(playback_est, method = 1, pb = FALSE)

# check output class
is_extended_selection_table(sc)
```

The output is also similar to that of `envelope_correlation()`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# print output
sc
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}

kbl <- kable(sc, align = "c", row.names = F, format = "html", escape = F)

kbl <- column_spec(kbl, 9:10, background = "#ccebff", bold = TRUE)

kbl <- kable_styling(kbl, bootstrap_options = "striped", font_size = 10)

kbl <- scroll_box(kbl, height = "400px")

kbl
```

&nbsp;

As in `envelope_correlation()`, `spectrum_correlation()` doesn't provide a graphical output. However, the graphs generated by `spectrum_blur_ratio()` can also be used to inspect the spectrum shapes and the sound alignment.

### Signal-to-noise ratio

Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) quantifies sound amplitude level in relation to ambient noise as a metric of overall sound attenuation. Therefore, attenuation refers to the loss of energy as described by Dabelsteen et al (1993). This method is implemented in the function `signal_to_noise_ratio()`. The function requires a measurement of ambient noise, which could either be the noise right before each sound (`noise.ref = "adjacent"`) or one or more ambient noise measurements per recording (`noise.ref = "custom"`). For the latter, selections on sound parameters in which ambient noise will be measured must be specified. Alternatively, one or more selections of ambient noise can be used as reference (see 'noise.ref' argument). This can potentially provide a more accurate representation of ambient noise. When margins overlap with another acoustic signal nearby, SNR will be inaccurate, so margin length should be carefully considered. Any SNR less than or equal to one suggests background noise is equal to or overpowering the acoustic signal. SNR can be measured as follows:

```{r, eval = TRUE}

# run signal to noise ratio
sa <- signal_to_noise_ratio(playback_est, pb = FALSE, noise.ref = "custom")

# check output class
is_extended_selection_table(sa)
```

The output is also similar to the other functions:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# print output
sa
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}


kbl <- kable(sa, align = "c", row.names = F, format = "html", escape = F)

kbl <- column_spec(kbl, 9, background = "#ccebff", bold = TRUE)

kbl <- kable_styling(kbl, bootstrap_options = "striped", font_size = 10)

kbl <- scroll_box(kbl, height = "400px")

kbl
```

&nbsp;

Note that this function does not compare sounds to references, so no reference column is added.

### Tail-to-signal ratio

Tail-to-signal ratio (TSR) is used to quantify reverberations. Specifically TSR measures the ratio of energy in the reverberation tail  (the time segment right after the sound) to energy in the sound. A general margin in which reverberation tail will be measured must be specified. The function will measure TSR within the supplied frequency range (e.g. bandpass) of the reference sound ('bottom.freq' and 'top.freq' columns in 'X'). Two methods for calculating reverberations are provided (see 'type' argument). `Type 1` is based on the original description of TSR in Dabelsteen et al. (1993) while `type 2` is better referred to as "tail-to-noise ratio", given that it compares the amplitude of tails to those of ambient noise. For both types higher values represent more reverberations. TSR can be measured as follows:

```{r, eval = TRUE}

# run tail to signal ratio
tsr <- tail_to_signal_ratio(playback_est,
  pb = FALSE,
  type = 1, mar = 0.05
)

# check output class
is_extended_selection_table(tsr)
```

Again, the output is similar to other functions:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# print output

tsr
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}


kbl <- kable(tsr, align = "c", row.names = F, format = "html", escape = F)

kbl <- column_spec(kbl, 9, background = "#ccebff", bold = TRUE)

kbl <- kable_styling(kbl, bootstrap_options = "striped", font_size = 10)

kbl <- scroll_box(kbl, height = "400px")

kbl
```

&nbsp;

### Spectrogram distortion

Finally, the function `spcc()` measures spectrogram cross-correlation as a metric of sound distortion of sounds. Values close to 1 means very similar spectrograms (i.e. little sound distortion). The function is a wrapper on [warbleR](https://cran.r-project.org/package=warbleR)'s `cross_correlation()`. It can be run as follows:

```{r, eval = TRUE}

# run spcc
spd <- spcc(X = playback_est, method = 1, wl = 512, pb = FALSE)

# check output class
is_extended_selection_table(spd)
```

And again, the output is similar to other functions:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# print output
spd
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}

kbl <- kable(spd, align = "c", row.names = F, format = "html", escape = F)

kbl <- column_spec(kbl, 9:10, background = "#ccebff", bold = TRUE)

kbl <- kable_styling(kbl, bootstrap_options = "striped", font_size = 10)

kbl <- scroll_box(kbl, height = "400px")

kbl
```

&nbsp;

## Other measurements

### Noise profiles

The function `noise_profile()` allows to estimate the frequency spectrum of ambient noise. This can be done on extended selection tables (using the segments containing no sound) or over complete sound files in the working directory (or path supplied). The function uses \code{\link[seewave]{meanspec}} internally to calculate frequency spectra. The following code measures the ambient noise profile for the recordings at distance >= 5m on the example extended selection table:

```{r, eval = TRUE}

# run noise profile
np <- noise_profile(X = playback_est[playback_est$distance > 5, ], mar = 0.05)
```

The output is a data frame with amplitude values for the frequency bins for each wave object in the extended selection table:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# print output
head(np, 20)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}

kbl <- kable(np[1:20, ], align = "c", row.names = F, format = "html", escape = F)

kbl <- column_spec(kbl, 2:3, background = "#ccebff", bold = TRUE)

kbl <- kable_styling(kbl, bootstrap_options = "striped", font_size = 10)

kbl <- scroll_box(kbl, height = "400px")

kbl
```

This can be graphically represented as follows:

```{r, eval = TRUE}

ggplot(np, aes(y = amp, x = freq, col = sound.files)) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1.4) +
  scale_color_viridis_d(begin = 0.2, end = 0.8, alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(x = "Frequency (kHz)", y = "Amplitude (dBA)") +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_classic()
```

The output data is actually an average of several frequency spectra for each sound file. We can obtain the original spectra by setting the argument `averaged = FALSE`: 

```{r, eval = TRUE, warning = FALSE}

np <- noise_profile(
  X = playback_est[playback_est$distance > 5, ],
  mar = 0.1, averaged = FALSE
)

# make a column containing sound file and selection
np$sf.sl <- paste(np$sound.files, np$selec)

ggplot(np, aes(y = amp, x = freq, col = sound.files, group = sf.sl)) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1.4) +
  scale_color_viridis_d(begin = 0.2, end = 0.8, alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(x = "Frequency (kHz)", y = "Amplitude (dBA)") +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_classic()
```

Note that we can limit the frequency range by using a bandpass filter ('bp' argument). In addition, the argument 'hop.size', which control the size of the time windows, affects the precision in the frequency domain. We can get a better precision by increasing 'hop.size' (or 'wl'):


```{r, eval = TRUE}

np <- noise_profile(
  X = playback_est[playback_est$distance > 5, ],
  mar = 0.05, bp = c(0, 10),
  averaged = FALSE, hop.size = 3
)

# make a column containing sound file and selection
np$sf.sl <- paste(np$sound.files, np$selec)

ggplot(np, aes(y = amp, x = freq, col = sound.files, group = sf.sl)) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1.4) +
  scale_color_viridis_d(begin = 0.2, end = 0.8, alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(x = "Frequency (kHz)", y = "Amplitude (dBA)") +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_classic()
```


The function can estimate noise profiles for complete sound files, by supplying a list of the files (argument 'files', and not supplying  'X') or by simply running it without supplying 'X' or 'files'. In this case it will run over all sound files in the working directory (or 'path' supplied).
